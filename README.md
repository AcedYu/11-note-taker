# 11-note-taker
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 11 for the program. In this assignment I modified some given starter code to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

<!-- It contains notable features such as:
- A landing page with a link to a notes page
- Clickable list of notes onthe left, and a note entry form on the right-->
